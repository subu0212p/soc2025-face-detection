# Key Concepts Learned So Far

- NumPy: arrays, shape, broadcasting, matrix ops
- Pandas: DataFrames, filtering, adding columns
- Matplotlib: plot(), bar(), labels, grid
- TensorFlow: layers, models, input shapes
- Siamese Network: twin subnetworks, shared weights, distance-based comparison

Main idea: Use deep learning to compare two face images and check if they belong to the same person.
