# The Eyes of the Machine: A Journey into Face Detection

Welcome to my SOC 2025 project repo!  
This is my end-to-end learning journey into building a face recognition system using a Siamese Neural Network, Python, and the classic student hustle.

## 📖 Learning Journey Summary

### 🔹 Python Basics
- Completed up to Lecture 70 of CodeWithHarry's [100 Days of Python Playlist]
- Learned the essentials:
  - Variables, loops, conditionals
  - Functions, OOP, and modules
  - File handling, error handling

### 🔹 Python Modules
- **NumPy:** Arrays, reshaping, broadcasting, linear algebra
- **Pandas:** DataFrames, cleaning, filtering, aggregation
- **Matplotlib:** Data visualization with plots and charts

### 🔹 Tools & Frameworks
- **OpenCV:** Image input, pre-processing, detection
- **TensorFlow:** Building and training deep learning models
- **Siamese Neural Network:** For image similarity and face recognition

## 🚀 What I Did

- Finished Python basics and built my coding foundation.
- Practiced essential data libraries (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib).
- Understood the overall Siamese Network project architecture.
- Set up and organized the GitHub repo for smooth progress.
- Started experimenting with TensorFlow and OpenCV.
- Trained and tested a basic face recognition model using my own and public face images.
- Debugged (and survived) errors with installations, GPUs, and datasets along the way!
