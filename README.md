- Variables, Loops, Conditionals
- Functions, OOP, Modules
- File handling, Error handling

### ðŸ”¹ Python Modules
1. **NumPy** â€“ Arrays, reshaping, broadcasting, and linear algebra  
2. **Pandas** â€“ DataFrames, cleaning, filtering, aggregation  
3. **Matplotlib** â€“ Data visualization using plots and charts

### ðŸ”¹ Tools & Frameworks
- **OpenCV** â€“ For image input, pre-processing, and detection
- **TensorFlow** â€“ For building and training deep learning models
- **Siamese Neural Network** â€“ For image similarity and face recognition
