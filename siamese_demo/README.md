# ðŸ§  Siamese Network Demo

This folder contains the initial code setup for exploring the Siamese Neural Network architecture.

## Files

- `siamese_architecture.py` â€” Defines the base network used for feature extraction.
- `similarity_test.py` â€” Tests how the network compares two dummy images using Euclidean distance.

## Next Steps

- Replace random images with real face data (LFW or selfie pairs).
- Add a contrastive loss function and pair generator for training.
- Integrate with OpenCV for live face input.
